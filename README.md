# Earth-like-Fantasy-World-Generation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and all the needed python modules downloaded
2. Run the Voronoi 5.11.3.py program in IDLE
3. Run the pygame_test.py program in IDLE to access the UI for the project.
NOTE: Currently, the questions asked in the commandline do nothing to the actual program.
4. To swap between map mode, press 'W'(River Map),'A'(Tectonic Plate Map),'S'(Basic Height Map), or 'D'(Ocean Current Map) keys.
You can right-click on the map image to view information about that specific pixel clicked (currently only shows x and y coordinates)
